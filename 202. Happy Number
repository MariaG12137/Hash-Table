/*
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

Example: 
*/
var isHappy = function(n) {
    let result = new Set();
    
    while(true){
        if(result.has(n) && n !== 1){
            return false;
        }
        if(n===1){
            return true;
        }
        result.add(n);
        let string = n.toString().split("").map((char)=>parseInt(char));
        n = string.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc+Math.pow(curr,2),0);    
    }
};
